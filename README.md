# üè∑Ô∏è Expose your Discord presence and activities to a RESTful API and WebSocket in less than 10 seconds

Exoix is a service that makes it super easy to export your live Discord presence to an API endpoint (`api.Exoix.rest/v1/users/:your_id`) and to a WebSocket (see below) for you to use wherever you want - for example, I use this to display what I'm listening to on Spotify on my personal website. It also acts as a globally-accessible realtime KV store which you can update from the Exoix Discord bot or from the Exoix API.

You can use Exoix's API without deploying anything yourself - but if you want to self host it, you have the option to, though it'll require a tiny bit of configuration.

## Get started in < 10 seconds

Just [join this Discord server](https://discord.gg/UrXF2cfJ7F) and your presence will start showing up when you `GET api.Exoix.rest/v1/users/:your_id`. It's that easy.

### KV

Exoix KV is a a dynamic, real-time key->value store which is added to the Exoix user API response. When a KV pair is updated, a `PRESENCE_UPDATE` for the user will also be emitted through the Exoix socket.

#### Use cases

- Configuration values for your website
- Configuration values for Exoix 3rd party projects
- Dynamic data for your website/profile (e.g. current location)

#### Limits

1. Keys and values can only be strings
2. Values can be 30,000 characters maximum
3. Keys must be alphanumeric (a-zA-Z0-9) and 255 characters max length
4. Your user can have a maximum of 512 key->value pairs linked

#### Getting an API Key

DM the Exoix bot (`Exoix#5766`) with `.apikey` to get your API key.

When making Exoix KV API requests, set an `Authorization` header with the API key you received from the Exoix bot as the value.

#### Setting a key->value pair

##### Discord

`.set <key> <value>`

##### HTTP

`PUT https://api.Exoix.rest/v1/users/:user_id/kv/:key`
The value will be set to the body of the request. The body can be any type of data, but it will be string-encoded when set in Exoix KV.

#### Setting multiple key->value pairs

##### Discord

Not yet implemented

##### HTTP

`PATCH https://api.Exoix.rest/v1/users/:user_id/kv`
The user's KV store will be merged with the body of the request. Conflicting keys will be overwritten. The body must be keyvalue pair object with a maximum depth of 1.

#### Deleting a key

##### Discord

`.del <key>`

##### HTTP

`DELETE https://api.Exoix.rest/v1/users/:user_id/kv/:key`

## Socket Docs

The websocket is available at `wss://api.Exoix.rest/socket`. If you would like to use compression, please specify `?compression=zlib_json` at the end of the URL.

Once connected, you will receive Opcode 1: Hello which will contain heartbeat_interval in the data field. You should set a repeating interval for the time specified in heartbeat_interval which should send Opcode 3: Heartbeat on the interval.

You should send `Opcode 2: Initialize` immediately after receiving Opcode 1.

Example of `Opcode 2: Initialize`:

```js
{
  op: 2,
  d: {
    // subscribe_to_ids should be an array of user IDs you want to subscribe to presences from
    // if Exoix doesn't monitor an ID specified, it won't be included in INIT_STATE
    subscribe_to_ids: ["94490510688792576"]
  }
}
```

#### Subscribing to multiple user presences

To subscribe to multiple presences, send `subscribe_to_ids` in the data object with a `string[]` list of user IDs to subscribe to. Then, INIT_STATE's data object will contain a user_id->presence map. You can find examples below.

#### Subscribing to a single user presence

If you just want to subscribe to one user, you can send `subscribe_to_id` instead with a string of a single user ID to subscribe to. Then, the INIT_STATE's data will just contain the presence object for the user you've subscribed to instead of a user_id->presence map.

#### Subscribing to every user presence

If you want to subscribe to every presence being monitored by Exoix, you can specify `subscribe_to_all` with (bool) `true` in the data object, and you will then receive a user_id->presence map with every user presence in INIT_STATE, and their respective PRESENCE_UPDATES when they happen.

Once Op 2 is sent, you should immediately receive an `INIT_STATE` event payload if connected successfully. If not, you will be disconnected with an error (see below).

### List of Opcodes

| Opcode | Name       | Description                                                                                                                 | Client Send/Recv |
| ------ | ---------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------- |
| 0      | Event      | This is the default opcode when receiving core events from Exoix, like `INIT_STATE`                                       | Receive          |
| 1      | Hello      | Exoix sends this when clients initially connect, and it includes the heartbeat interval                                   | Receive Only     |
| 2      | Initialize | This is what the client sends when receiving Opcode 1 from Exoix - it should contain an array of user IDs to subscribe to | Send only        |
| 3      | Heartbeat  | Clients should send Opcode 3 every 30 seconds (or whatever the Hello Opcode says to heartbeat at)                           | Send only        |

### Events

Events are received on `Opcode 0: Event` - the event type will be part of the root message object under the `t` key.

#### Example Event Message Objects

#### `INIT_STATE`

```js
{
  op: 0,
  seq: 1,
  t: "INIT_STATE",
  d: {
    "94490510688792576": {
      // Full Exoix presence (see API docs above for example)
    }
  }
}
```

#### `PRESENCE_UPDATE`

```js
{
  op: 0,
  seq: 2,
  t: "PRESENCE_UPDATE",
  d: {
    // Full Exoix presence and an extra "user_id" field
  }
}
```

### Error Codes

Exoix can disconnect clients for multiple reasons, usually to do with messages being badly formatted. Please refer to your WebSocket client to see how you should handle errors - they do not get received as regular messages.

#### Types of Errors

| Name                   | Code | Data                   |
| ---------------------- | ---- | ---------------------- |
| Invalid/Unknown Opcode | 4004 | `unknown_opcode`       |
| Opcode Requires Data   | 4005 | `requires_data_object` |
| Invalid Payload        | 4006 | `invalid_payload`      |

## Quicklinks

Exoix quicklinks allow you to easily access resources from Discord, such as profile pictures.

### User Icons

`https://api.Exoix.rest/<id>.<file_type>`
Where `id` is the Discord user ID. `file_type` can be one of: `png`, `gif`, `webp`, `jpg`, or `jpeg`

## Self-host with Docker

Build the Docker image by cloning this repo and running:

```bash
# The latest version is already on the docker hub, you can skip this step unless you would like to run a modified version.
docker build -t phineas/Exoix:latest .
```

If you don't already have a redis server you'll need to run one, here's the docker command to run one:

```bash
docker run -d --name Exoix-redis -v docker_mount_location_on_host:/data redis
```

And run Exoix API server using:

```bash
docker run --rm -it -p 4001:4001 -e REDIS_HOST=redis -e BOT_TOKEN=<token> --link Exoix-redis:redis phineas/Exoix:latest
```

You'll be able to access the API using **port 4001**.

You also need to create a Discord bot and use its token above.

Create a bot here: https://discord.com/developers/applications

**Make sure you enable** these settings in your bot settings:

- Privileged Gateway Intents > **PRESENCE INTENT**
- Privileged Gateway Intents > **SERVER MEMBERS INTENT**

If you'd like to run Exoix with `docker-compose`, here's an example:

```yml
version: "3.8"

services:
  redis:
    image: redis
    restart: always
    container_name: Exoix_redis
  Exoix:
    image: phineas/Exoix:latest
    restart: always
    container_name: Exoix
    depends_on:
      - redis
    ports:
      - 4001:4001
    environment:
      BOT_TOKEN: <token>
      REDIS_HOST: redis
```

Note, that you're **hosting a http server, not https**. You'll need to use a **reverse proxy** such as [traefik](https://traefik.io/traefik/) if you want to secure your API endpoint.
